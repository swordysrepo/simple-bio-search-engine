lol i hate n^2 problems
the thing is sometimes an off shoot article may be meaningful
so well have to brute it

this thing can search all of those articles based on waht users are looking for .. and then further index based on inclusion of specific words in those articles .
maybe even more specifically how many times... and designing a quality index

i mean out of 20 mill articles well prb get some 10k entries for each term
so not bad
caching comes in later
swordy — Today at 7:51 PM
the main thing is 20 million articles is nuts to obtain , and continuously retrieving 20 million new articles

yeah the list is larger
well its no complete
but would make a difference in searching
one idea is also to connect this to opencog
opencog is a general ai thing
that way it can do research much faster
u know sophia the ai on youtube
her brains are on github

i've heard an AI that answers phones
havent heard of sophia the AI

the way they put info is in a knowledge base
essentially a tree
so u cut braches, add new ones, compare etc
kinda like what a human brain does
in science usually new articles have more worth than old ones
so popularity in this case isnt gonna work best
its usually about the things we dont know yet
swordy — Today at 7:56 PM
imagine generating new articles based on old ones :smile:
jax — Today at 7:56 PM
yeah thats the idea
i do learn new things from old articles
theres an project called entrez for bio
usually lets u do searches across their dbs
one thing that seems to be an issue with mass data is speed
i mean another thing would be to just build a massive hashmap
as much as u can fit
lol
